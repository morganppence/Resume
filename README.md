# Resume

In this project, I got to utilize Claude.AI to create a personalized resume. I uploaded a few digital sketches and was able to work with Claude to tailor the outcome to something I liked.

# Reflection
This was certainly a different process for me! I've never asked this much of AI before and found parts of going back and forth pretty frustrating. In the end, I do like the output I got to but feel like I could've taken fewer steps to get there if I did it again.
